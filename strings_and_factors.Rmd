## Strings and regex

```{r}
string_vec = c("my", "name", "is", "jeff")

str_detect(string_vec, "jeff")

str_replace(string_vec, "jeff", "Jeff")


```

```{r}
string_vec = c(
  "i think we all rule for participating",
  "i think i have been caught",
  "i think this will be quite fun actually",
  "it will be fun, i think"
  )

str_detect(string_vec, "i think")
str_detect(string_vec, "^i think")
## i want to detect the beginning of the line, then "i think"

str_detect(string_vec, "i think$")
```

```{r}
string_vec = c(
  "Y'all remember Pres. HW Bush?",
  "I saw a green bush",
  "BBQ and Bushwalking at Molonglo Gorge",
  "BUSH -- LIVE IN CONCERT!!"
  )

str_detect(string_vec, "[Bb]ush")
## for this location, you can detect capital or lowercase B as long as it's followed by "ush"
```

```{r}
string_vec = c(
  '7th inning stretch',
  '1st half soon to begin. Texas won the toss.',
  'she is 5 feet 4 inches tall',
  '3AM - cant sleep :('
  )

str_detect(string_vec, "^[0-9][a-zA-Z]")
```

```{r}
string_vec = c(
  'Its 7:11 in the evening',
  'want to go to 7-11?',
  'my flight is AA711',
  'NetBios: scanning ip 203.167.114.66'
  )

str_detect(string_vec, "7.11")
## dot is a special signal in regular expressions that matches literally any other thing that exists in the string.

## if you want to match a dot specifically, and interpret it as a regular dot:

str_detect(string_vec, "7\\.11")

##because the slash itself is also a special signal, you need two slashes.
```

```{r}
string_vec = c(
  'The CI is [2, 5]',
  ':-]',
  ':-[',
  'I found the answer on pages [6-7]'
  )

str_detect(string_vec, "\\[")
```

## Factors

```{r}
factor_vec = factor(c("male", "male", "female", "female"))

## This will give me information about levels in alphabetical order

as.numeric(factor_vec)

## says realy underneath this, female is a 1 and male is a 2. the integer structure that underlies the factor variable that i have created.
```

what happens if i relevel...

```{r}
factor_vec = fct_relevel(factor_vec, "male") 

factor_vec

as.numeric(factor_vec)

```

most used fct_ commands: fct_relevel, fct_recode (lets you change a label), fct_reorder

```{r}

```
